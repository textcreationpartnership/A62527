            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Coppe</hi> was then to Preach, having not long before heard of his Recantation and liberty, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to underſtand of the worke of
<pb facs="tcp:106859:4"/>God upon him: upon this account I haſtned to the Church, when I came to the doore, I ſaw there much people rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to heare, but the Pulpit empty, and no one there as yet to Preach. I was no ſooner thinking, whether I were beſt to ſtay that houre, or immediatly to returne from whence I came, then I was preſt in Spirit, a Scripture with ſtrong impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being preſented to me, to take the opportunity of ſpeaking ſomething to the People, ere M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

I had rather ye would rend my bowels, ſtab me to the heart, ſpill my blood as water upon the ground, then reproach, blaſpheme, deſpiſe, that blood, which was the price of my redemption, God will judge for this. Should not I ſpeak, the ſtones would, mans bloud cries, but Chriſts cries loud.

            <p>As for the occaſion of the words and the Epiſtle, you may underſtand, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia was a newly planted-Church, the light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt had lately broken in upon them, in purity and with power. the Apoſtles had ſo Preach'd it, theſe Galatians had ſo received it.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes it fell out with them, as with moſt other Churches, not onely in ours, but the Apoſtles times where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God had yet his Church, there the Divell would have his Chappell. Hee'le have his Goſpel and his Preachers too, though both accurſed.</p>
            <p>There were ſome troublers, perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this glorious Goſpel of Chriſt crept in among them, and as it ſeemed overthrew the faith of ſome. <hi>I marvaile that you are ſo ſoon removed &amp;c. from him that called you into the Grace of Christ.</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the ſound profeſſion of the Goſpel, which is the doctrine of the free and rich grace of God, ſaving ſinners by a Chriſt, his righteouſneſſe, his death <hi>v.</hi> 6. his blood, his ſacrifice, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>God-Salvation-Grace,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Goſpel, any other doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, beſide that by the grace of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106859:10"/>Chriſt, is another Goſpel farre different from, and directly contrary to, that Goſpel which God revealed, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is not another. though the Divel and falſe Apoſtles may conſpire to frame and deviſe another Goſpel, then the true Goſpel, revealing Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the grace of Chriſt, yet 'tis no true Goſpel. there is but one Goſpel, there is not another Goſpel, beſide that one which is indeed a Goſpel, brings glad tidings of ſalvation. there's not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel. to us there is but one God, one ſalvation, one Mediator, one Faith, one Goſpel. againſt ſuch Goſpels and Goſpellers, the Apoſtle oppoſes theſe two or three verſes, which I have read.</p>
            <p>He tels them their troublers were the Perverters of the Goſpell, nay more then ſo, theſe <hi>Perverters and their Doctrines</hi> were both accurſed, and ſo to be accounted by them, whatever they might pretend themſelves, or theirs to be.

               <hi>John</hi> mett with ſuch as denyed the Divinity of the Sonne of God. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuch as denyed the Imputative Righteouſnes of Jeſus Chriſt, the Reſnrrection of the Dead. Some there were that told them the Reſurrection was paſt already,

            <p>It cannot be more ſtrange now in our daies, on whom the very ends of the world are come: Our bleſſed Saviour for 1600 yeares agoe foretold us this, read through the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and there you'le ſee that even in theſe dais, there are to be falſe Chriſts, &amp; falſe Prophets, &amp; ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders, and if it were poſſible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very Elect: they ſhall ſay loe here is Chriſt, and loe there is Chriſt, but beleeve them not, take heed that no man deceive you. Here's a Prophecy of falſe Teachers, even the groſſeſt in theſe latter Ages of the World, note firſt their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> they hold new Chriſts, and many Chriſts, ſeverall Chriſts, loe here, and loe there a Chriſt, even as many Chriſts as men. Secondly their growth, their pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, to deceive even the very Elect. The Temptation it ſeemes muſt fal hard even upon the Elect of God, not the groſſer part only of the world, but even the very Elect ſhould be quite (were it not Impoſſible) to be deceived by them. Such as belong to Election, given to Chriſt, taken into an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106859:12"/>with God, it may go hard with them, but becauſe of their Election, they ſhall not be finally deceived. Thirdly, Their power, ſignes, and wonders, but for lying wonders, we have enough of thoſe. Fourthly, Take this Caution, think not this ſtrange, when it comes to paſſe, ſee I have told you, be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there will be, if Chriſt be true, falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and utterly deceive many, though the Elect ſhall ſtand. So you have in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. throughout, and in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> there ſhall be falſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> even denying the Lord that bought them. Damnable Hereſie, they bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, read the Chapter, and the 3. verſe of <hi>Jude,</hi> ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men denying the only Lord God, and even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, turning the grace of God into Laſciviouſneſſe, (as ſome of theſe ſay, let us ſin that grace may abound,) even as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and going after <hi>ſtrange Fleſh,</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dreamers, note that, I have heard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of them, defile the fleſh, deſpiſe Dominion, ſpeak evill of Dignities,

            <p>Think it not ſtrange if you meet with ſuch now, the Scripture is true, they make it good, you are forewarned, their Goſpel are curſed Goſpels, but of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>

            <p>You ſhall find this was the work of the true Prophets againſt the falſe: the true Apoſtles againſt the falſe Apoſtles.

            <p>I ſhall give you ſome Characters of true-Goſpel doctrine and preachers. I had rather ſhew you the true then rake all dunghils for the falſe, truth will manifeſt errour. I take this as the maine. That's the true Goſpel, and they are the true-Goſpel preachers, that lay the whole <hi>weight and burthen</hi> of our ſalvation on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106859:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſon of man Equall with God, that is God, yet God in our fleſh, our <hi>nature</hi> I meane not our particular perſons, as they would have it, who deſpiſe this Chriſt, they lay ſalvation on a Chriſt within them, this Chriſt within, in the Goſpel ſence, is true but in theirs is groſſely falſe. however the <hi>ſtreſſe</hi> of our ſalvation lyes not there, that may bee an Evidence, an Earneſt of ſalvation but Chriſt in the <hi>wombe</hi> of the virgin Mary, Chriſt lying in the <hi>manger,</hi> Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Judaea, that poore deſpiſed Chriſt, that <hi>Carpenters</hi> ſon, as ſome abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably call him, is the true Chriſt; and the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of our ſalvation: that Chriſt, that lived here on earth in a low meane way was crucified at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, dying upon the Croſſe, lying in the grave, ariſing againe the third day, viſibly and corporally aſcending into heaven, and fitting now there at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, thats the true Chriſt, and our Saviour, that Chriſt, that ſhall come againe in the ſame viſible way, bodily way, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he went up into heaven, to judge the World, render to quick and dead, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> every man, all fleſh,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106859:15"/>according to their deeds done in the fleſh, that ſhall take his Saints into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and curſe the wicked and blaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to eternall torments: thats the true Chriſt, and the true Goſpel places Salvation in this Chriſt and in no other. This is our Saviour, our Redeemer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there Salvation in any other. not in Men, not in Angels, no not in God himſelfe abſtracted from this Chriſt that was borne of Mary, lay in the manger, died on the Croſſe doe yee know what God out of that Chriſt is? he is a conſuming fire. Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning, and who ſhall dwell with him? ſhall ſtubble? God out of that Chriſt conſidered is an Idoll not our God. for God is now God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in our fleſh, in our nature, the fleſh that was at Jeruſalem upon the Croſſe, now in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That's the true Goſpel which holds out the true ſalvation, and true damnation, the ſtates of men after this life. Salvation 'tis true in ſome ſence is begun here, in title, earneſt, firſt fruits. but ſalvation, to ſpeake fully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of ſalvation, is a ſtate to come. the wrath from which we are ſaved, is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106859:15"/>wrath to come, and the great Evill of ſin, though I ſay ſome be here, is yet to come Even then when Chriſt, that Chriſt, of whom we ſpeake ſhall appear. not to our fancies, not in the worke of grace, neither in the ſpeciall tokens of his ſpirituall preſence, but appeare <hi>bodily, corporally, viſibly.</hi> then ſhall we ſee him as he is, and not till then. then ſhall he appeare unto our compleate Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not till then. other ſalvation there is not. vile wretches ye are that would deſtroy and annihilate ſalvation it ſelfe: We ſhall have our bodies, and with theſe eyes ſhall we then ſee our ſweet redeemer. Salvation is not a phancy. 'tis reall and for its fulneſſe 'tis yet to come. firſt comes death and judgement, and then compleate ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. and for damnation and hell, let fooles make a mock of <hi>Hell,</hi> they ſhall find there is another hell, beſide that <hi>fancied</hi> hell of theirs in this life, ſome of them (I will not ſay all) are ordained of old unto this deſtruction, they are reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe, to the blackneſſe of the darkneſſe of that day. He that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, but he that beleeveth not he ſhall be damned.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The true Goſpel laies the maine cauſe of our ſalvation next to the work of God the father, on the obedience, on righteouſneſſe,

            </p>
            <p>What I have to ſay upon the account of theſe aſſertions of divine truth under execrations is briefely this.</p>
            <p>I moſt gratefully accept theſe aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Coppe.</hi> I heartily thank him for them, upon the account of truth, that he would ſo freely, ſo pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically profeſſe his aſſent unto it. if he were ingenious, (I will not yet queſtion it) Chriſt and truth will thank him too. 2. Upon mine own account, I thanke him, that he would take ſo much paines as to repeate it, even in mine own words, and to confirme it, as he did with execrations. I profeſſe I had no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prejudice againſt his perſon as ſuch, in my diſcourſe, I thank him, he expreſt no more againſt mine in his.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I wiſh all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Coppes</hi> hearers would well conſider his aſſeverations, that ſuch as have been deceived, would be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and as I ſaid before, if God will, convinced and converted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I wiſh that all ſound Chriſtians would take notice, 1. Of the <hi>ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and divinity of Goſpel-truth,</hi> even M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And as for him, if it may appeare by theſe notes or his own diſcourſe, that he is the ſame what he was before, only more cunning. 1.

            <p>As I remember this was the firſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let it be the firſt here. <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt was Crucified at Ieruſalem, let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth if I deny that. Chriſt was Crucified in Sodom and Aegypt, curſed be he that denyes this.</hi>
               </q> Theſe words were again and again repeated, without a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to their reconciliation or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106859:27"/>
            <p>What might be his meaning let the World judge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tell you how Familiſts uſe to ſpeak, and what they generally intend when they thus ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you the Scripture meaning, as to thoſe Aſſertions under this Queſtion. <hi>How is it ſaid that Chriſt was Crucified at Ieruſalem? How may it be ſaid that Chriſt was Crucified as in Sodom and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Familiſts uſe to ſpeak one thinge and mean another:
<note place="margin">Por:</note> as you may ſee in the Epiſtle: One diſputed with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Deity of Chriſt before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, he denyed that Chriſt was God, or Jehovah, 'twas prov'd, the man was charg'd by the Committee with it, he preſently told them he meant not ſo. the like.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's <hi>Imputative</hi> righteouſnes is a ſapleſſe righteouſnes, but he meant not ſo. They will ſay and unſay in one breath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Before the late Act againſt <hi>Raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> they ſpake boldly, now they dare not, eſpecially in points againſt the light of <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Since the pretence of the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106859:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ſeverall of them to the way of truth, they have a <hi>generall ſtraine</hi> of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their corrupt notions with ſound words, eſpecially ſuch Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as will beare a generall ſence, as to Inſtance. They will tell you that Chriſt was <hi>Crucified</hi> at Ieruſalem, a ſound expreſſion, there generall ſence is true, he was Crucified at Ieruſalem, but in what ſence? abominably corrupt, as a type and figure of the true death of Chriſt in them (as they pretend.) An harmleſſe Chriſtian, that would wrong none, and things none would wrong him, takes all well, the man (ſaies he) <q>ſpeaks truth, delivers ſpeciall truth, he granted that Chriſt died on the Croſſe, he does not deny that Chriſt died for our ſinnes, according to the Scripture</q> but poore heart, he never intended thou ſhouldeſt ſo apply it. Again he will tell you, <hi>by Chriſts blood,</hi> that you are ſaved: my ſelf not long ſince heard words like theſe, I thought no harm, but that by Chriſts blood, the man meant the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of our ſalvation. But it ſeems 'tis one of their curſed formes of ſwearing, like that, the plague of God take all fleſh, of curſing: I ſhould trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106859:28"/>to write this, but to diſcover Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts—</p>
            <p n="4">4. It ſeems to me, from what I have knowne of them, they will put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on all expreſſions, wayes &amp; wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to keep themſelves from being <hi>known,</hi> but to their <hi>owne:</hi> you ſhall not know where to find them, ſo as to faſten on them, but their own ſhall know their meaning, and ſo may you when you have once got their <hi>Key.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of canting Beggers, and ſeen ſome ſuch books, for their ſakes I ſhall not eaſily beleeve ſome <hi>Recantations.</hi> A Key to Familiſme hath coſt me more than Ile now mention.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are deſigners, &amp; we may not be ignorant of their devices, they have learnt theſe of their blaſphemous ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader, when 'tis for their purpoſe, they will tell you Scripture ſpeakes it for them, and none then ſhall ſpeake for Scripture, more then they. Another time they will let you know, they care no more for Scripture then <hi>Geſta Romanorum,</hi> and likely ſcarce ſo much.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When they ſpeak on the account of Scripture Revelation, they will tell you, if you will beleeve it, that the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106859:29"/>Copy is their <hi>Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. I find it is one of their cloſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and undertakings, in undermining Scripture, if poſſibly they can, to make one claſh againſt another. Their drift is to weaken the Verity, Harmony, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scripture, in the weakeſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination. When they have done that, they laugh, you are as they would have it: they'l ſet truth and Scripture as 'twere together by the eares, and ſport at it. I ſay Scripture they undermine, and they have an 100 wayes for this, whereof this is one now hinted.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take this Rule wherever they be, they will be ſure (I meane the craftieſt of them) to cloſe in with you, in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, duties, that they may promote their deſigne upon you: you ſhall find it, for a never failing obſervation, they will firſt inſinuate an intereſt in your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then corrupt your judgments. They will ſmile upon you, and cut your throate: uſe melting words, <hi>Honny-ſweet,</hi> ſmooth as oyle, but full of poyſon. A Chriſt would they exalt <hi>within,</hi> and who would not? meekneſſe, love, peace, and righteouſneſſe would they promote, who likes not this? but friends, their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106859:29"/>Chriſt <hi>within,</hi> is to Crucifie that Chriſt without, to crucifie him as to your faith, your love, your delight, your joy—it will not be long ere yee heare of him, <q>That he was the Type, and but the Type of this within. God never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you ſhould beſaved by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall blood of a man, that's a fleſhly Chriſt we know him.</q> So no more: abuſing that Scripture, where <hi>Paul</hi> Preaches the ſpirituall ſtrength of the fleſh and blood, the naturall death of Chriſt in order to our Reconciliation: we know not Chriſt, 'tis true, barely as in the fleſh, but with ſpirituall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that blood as the price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thats the myſtery, Chriſt only dying that's but the Hiſtory) on this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Chriſt, farwell righteouſnes, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well too I ſay, ſalvation. and what becomes of love and meekneſſe: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, <hi>The Antichriſt?</hi> the myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is the beſt notion they can faſten on the Choiceſt Saynts, &amp; wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes. I have had the experience of theſe: &amp; therefore let the world know, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know, I doe not wrong them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Take this note likewiſe: there be ſeverall ſorts of Familiſts, the divell is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106859:30"/>cunning hee draws them on by ſteps: and ſecondly Gods more gratious, they would follow faſter, but becauſe they are his election, hee will not ſo farre leave them.</p>
            <p>I have heard of ſeverall ſorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels ſome white, ſome black. ſome of ſtronger parts, others more baſe, and ſervile, and beetle-headed. See <hi>Burton melanch.</hi> it may be ſo, there are as many ſorts of Familiſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Theſe ſeverall ſorts they have their ſeverall ſtreynes: the Laſcivious Familiſt hee turns all that way, the ſpeculative the Scepticall Familiſt he ſtrikes another way, will goe as farre as hell in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, though not in practiſe. He ſay this for all, they all dance the <hi>divels dirge</hi> 1. hee loves variety, there were no pleaſure for him elſe his ſport might bee ſooner ſpoyl'd.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Their Common principle is this, (though ſome will ſay it, others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it they beleeve it.) <hi>God is All, and All is God,</hi> but whether am I gone, let me now reſolve the queſtion. I hope if this may bee counted a digreſſion, yet not from my main deſigne, defence of truth, diſcovery of Enemies: It may bee

            </p>
            <p>Sol. 1. I ſay Chriſt was literally Crucified at Jeruſalem, I think none queſtion this, and therefore it needs no explanation. Chriſt Jeſus did lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hang there without the Citie upon the Croſſe, as a Sacrifice for our ſins.</p>

            <p n="1">1. 'Tis well known the Scripture ſpeaks of Rome.</p>

            <p>I think likewiſe, few but underſtand how Chriſt is ſaid to ſuffer with his members, even in the ſame ſenſe that they are ſaid to be his members. I hope none is ſo groſſe to take it in a groſſe ſenſe, though I knew a Familiſt once that did. Ile let that paſſe.</p>
            <p>There is a crucifying of Chriſt, and puttiug him to an open ſhame, even now while he is in glory, and Familiſts bloody hands cannot reach him in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I feare the crucifixion of Chriſt may be too ſadly put upon their account, and they will finde it ſo, when God comes to render recompence. how have they tortured Chriſt in Scripture? how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully have they ſpoken of the death, the croſſe, the blood, the perſon of Chriſt? I feare this will be reckoned and accounted <hi>Crucifying the Lord of glory.</hi> ſurely, they will be found as guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt, as thoſe that diſcerne not the Lords-body in the Sacrament.

            <p>He was, before he was borne: and he was with God, that was borne: and he was God, that was thus borne. See for this <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The union between theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a perſonall union.</p>

            <p>Though ſome Familiſts ſay Chriſt had not two natures, they lye.</p>
            <p>He was a perſon before, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, he is but one perſon now, though he be likewiſe humane.</p>
            <p>It is not now a God, and a Man, to ſpeak perſonally, but God man, though Man and God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The word was ſo made fleſh, that the God-head was not the Manhood, nor the Man-hood the God-head: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were diſtinct without mixture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, compoſition, though met in one perſon, and in a perſonall way united.</p>
            <p>A Familiſt told me the Deity was mingled with the ſoule of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Por.</note> The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106859:33"/>Scripture clearly ſpeaks againſt this, and reaſon too. but Familiſts care for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Word was ſo made fleſh, as that the fulneſſe of the God-head dwelt in Chriſt bodily, Chriſt had not only the fulneſſe of created Grace, in reſpect of which it is ſaid the ſpirit was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto him not by meaſure, and ſaid to be full of grace, and againe of his fulneſſe, have all we received grace for grace. this had ſpeciall relation to his Man-hood, I ſay he had not only this fulneſſe of grace, (I call it created becauſe it is not the God-head but the worke of God, a creature call'd a new creation, would Familiſts but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this 'twere ſomewhat, the Lord teach them.) but he had the fulneſſe of the God-head in him, likewiſe, more then grace, the <hi>God-head</hi> not only ſomething divine, a nature divine, ſomewhat like God, and from God, a neere reſemblance of God, but the Godhead or the Deity, &amp; this the fulnes of the God-head as much as the Deity is, was in Chriſt, &amp; that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, in conjunction with his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; body: or after ſome bodily, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſubſtantially, or <hi>ſubſistentially,</hi> but it may

            <p n="6">6. This word was ſo made fleſh or aſſumed fleſh, and took it into ſuch a neare (Conjunction with himſelf I ſay himſelf to note the perſonality of Chriſt before his incarnation) as that their is a communication of properties, and attributions. Chriſt God-man was God, though man,
<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. The Scripture ſayes that Chriſt is formed in us: ſo ſayes Paul to his Galatians: this is a nice point,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> but I ſhall ſpeak very plainely to it in few words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall tell you what familiſts doe underſtand by this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall tell you what Paul meant by it, and how wee are to underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Familiſts, their notion improved
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106859:34"/>ſpeaks this, that the <hi>Godhead</hi> (for perſons in the Trinity they acknowledge not, or as wee underſtand it.) the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, aſſumes unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>our particular</hi> perſonall <hi>fleſh, and bodies,</hi> as it aſſumed that particular fleſh and body which was framed and fitted for him by the Holy-ghoſt in the Virgins wombe.</p>
            <p>This is the thing they aime at; ſome of clearer reaſon note it ſo, others have more groſſe conceptions of it, according to their ſeverall Capacities.</p>
            <p>Some think that <hi>Every</hi> thing is God, and ſo they ſpeak plain, they ſay the Divel himſelf is God, as one told mee expreſſely that the Divel was God in darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Creation to <hi>God</hi> (the pure being of <hi>God</hi>) being nothing elſe (according to their apprehenſion) but ſo many <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> of <hi>God, God</hi> ſporting himſelf in ſo many ſhapes. now they diſtinguiſh when you come to aske whither they be <hi>God</hi> or no: as to inſtance, their bodie? they will tell you, no: they are not <hi>God:</hi> that is, their appearance, and the Creature (they will call it ſo) it is not <hi>God</hi> and in truth they judge ſo. (For the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106859:35"/>moſt part though ſin be groſſe indeed) <hi>I</hi> ſay they will diſtinguiſh thus, between the <hi>Creature and God,</hi> for they make it the appearance of <hi>God,</hi> if you aske them Concerning the nature of this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, what being it is, they vaniſh, &amp; can talk no longer. 'tis not they ſay, a reall thing but apparent, as the image in the glaſſe or water, or the image in our fancie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is their notion generally: others that are Come off from this, they take it in the firſt notion, the Godhead entring into a relation towards us our perſonall fleſh, particular bodys, and ſoul as it did to Chriſt: and this they underſtand by Chriſt formed in you.</p>
            <p>They ſay, this Chriſt (ſo now, they call it with relation to our fleſh, though ſometimes they call it God in us.) or God is <hi>fully</hi> in us, as hee was in Chriſt: onely it is not manifeſted wee doe not ſee it, aske them why it workes not ſo, as it did in Chriſt? they will tell you it hath its growthes and detriments, it is young, a babe, growne <hi>Crucified,</hi> and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againe in them, and many more ſuch ſtories they have of this.</p>
            <p>Many expreſſions they have to ſet out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106859:35"/>the nativity of Chriſt in us, as they term it—after the ſame manner as 'tis ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the birth of Chriſt in the wombe of the Virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>This is their opinion—now let me ſhew you Paules and I have done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not as the Familiſts would have it—God is not every thing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is not God.</p>
            <p>We are come now to the very root of the Divell. the Aſſertion that every thing is God is moſt helliſhly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Briefely, the Divell himſelfe never told our firſt parents that every thing was God, and therefore let God enjoy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, nothing is ſin to God, for every thing is God.</p>
            <p>He told them, they ſhould be <hi>As Gods,</hi> thats another matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If every thing were God, I ſay there were then no God. a God is a moſt abſolute ſpirituall ſimple immenſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infinite being, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For that which is every thing is no God. it implieth contrariety, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, weakneſſe, multiplicity, and what not? if God be every thing—he muſt be then good and evill, weake and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106859:36"/>ſtrong, finite and infinite, temporall and eternall, &amp;c. but why rake I here, when mans naturall heart cannot but abhorre this principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 2, If they ſay, true, the Creature is not God, in its being, ſo conſidered, but as <hi>it is in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with God it is God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwere, without all queſtion M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Coppe</hi> knowes the meaning of this, Familiſts, doe indeed ſay it. the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not God, why? God is inviſible, and the creature viſible, God a ſubſtance and the creature a ſhadow, God infinite and unlimited Almightineſſe, but the creature weakneſſe, &amp;c. but yet ſay they, there's ſome thing in the wind, they will tell you, that as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>quâ creatures,</hi> men and women, they are not God: no more then Chriſt was God <hi>quâ</hi> man: the Man-hood was not the God-head, but in nature property &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration diſtinct, but that as they are in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they are God. Even as was ſaid of Chriſt, the two natures united make a Chriſt, and that perſon is God—I ſay, here's the roote of the Divell in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme.</p>
            <p>If they meane this as to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106859:36"/>its moſt groſſely blaſphemous. the Divell himſelfe by this reckoning is God too.</p>
            <p>I think in my conſcience he is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the God of Familiſts, they have no other God for their God.</p>
            <p>But ſome I doe ſuppoſe referre it to good men, though I have but little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to thinke, yet I will be ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the ſake of thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and may think no more of it, eſpecially at firſt, then this, that a true convert is God in union.</p>
            <p>I ſay, firſt that every union with God cannot give the denomination of God, it is only a perſonall, as was ſaid of the perſon of Chriſt: there muſt be the very being of God perſonally ſubſiſting, or elſe it cannot be.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Every thing in union with God is not God. therefore cannot be truly called God, as it might be ſaid of Chriſt. if they were God, the properties of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, or the God-head, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theirs, they were omnipreſent, omnipotent, omniſcient. I deſired once that Familiſts would make it appeare they were God in union, as was ſaid of Chriſt. 1. By their omnipotency, let
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106859:37"/>them raiſe the dead, let them open the eyes of thoſe that are borne blind, let them doe that which man as ſuch, and aſſiſted by the Divell cannot doe. Chriſt could, and did ſo manifeſt his God-head. my workes bear witneſſe of me that I am true, and in the true ſence the Son of God. O poore weakneſſe—what have you yet done? Some I confeſſe, have playd the juglers and Conjurers, and Sorcerers—could raiſe Divells, and ſhew you fine ſights — dance over joynt ſtooles, and a hundred ſuch prankes you'l play.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them make it out by divine teſtimony, I meane immediate from God in glory, Chriſt had it—particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonally, this is my beloved Sonne, and in Scripture the mighty God.

            <p n="3">3. When did ever God ſay of them, as once of Chriſt, let all the Angels of God worſhip them. you Divels, will ye <hi>rob</hi> God of his honour? <hi>ſpoyle</hi> him? you ſhall not, he will not give his <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>Another,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Let them manifeſt it by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability—at leaſt in judgement. I have known ſome who will be for God and holineſſe to day, and for the Divell and darkneſſe, as the phraſe is, to morrow—God never yet chang'd his mind though men have thought ſo, nor God in union, the Lord Chriſt, he is the ſame yeſterday, and to day,

            <p>He was not to day a Saint, to morrow a Divel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Are yee God in union ſhew it by your omniſciency- Can ye like Chriſt ſearch hearts, and know their thoughts,

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>If this union be perſonall, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, as what is proper to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head may be attributed to the perſon, ſo what is attributed to the man-hood, ſhould be attributed to the perſon.</p>
            <p>The perſon thus in union ſhould be God-man. Infinite Immenſe, Eternal, &amp;c. Againe take the perſons of Familiſts as ſinners, and it may be ſaid as of Chriſt, God dying, ſo of Familiſts, God ſinning. God a ſwearer, God a drunkard, God a blaſpheamer. This would be ſweet ſtuff, yet it muſt be ſo, if God and a ſinner be perſonally united.</p>
            <p>Let me give you <hi>Pauls</hi> ſence of <hi>Christ formed in us,</hi> in the true ſence, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the clearer underſtanding of this myſtery; I ſhall ſpeak as plainly as I can, and the rather, becauſe ſome would charge me with denying, that Chriſt is in us, formed in us, &amp;c. I ſhall therefore grant as much as may be granted.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ſay, that true beleevers the called of God, they are really united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, one with Chriſt, one with the humane nature of Chriſt, one with the Divine nature of Chriſt, one with the

            <p n="2">2. We are one with God, in union (if you will) with God; one with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, one with the perſons in the God-head, Father, Sonne, and Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay that Chriſt is really in us, nay the perſon of Chriſt is in us.</p>

            <p n="5">5. I ſay that Chriſt is formed in us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That we are partakers of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my meaning in all this, I intend not what the Familiſts intend when they ſpeake this, as I have before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, I take it not in that ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay we are really united to God and Chriſt, as really as a branch is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vine, the wife to the husband, the building to the foundation, the head unto the members, and the members to the head; as really as the Father, and Sonne, and Spirit are one, which is one ſtep-farther.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106859:40"/>alway hold out the kind of the union, but for the moſt part the verity, the truth of the union it were groſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to aſſert other wiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt and <hi>God</hi> are really in us, but not in the ſame manner is <hi>God</hi> in us, as in the ſeverall perſons of the Trinity, or as in the humane nature of Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> have proved this already.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wee are united to the perſon of Chriſt but not made one perſon with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="4">4. Wee are really pertakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, but not in the ſame way and manner as Chriſt was partaker of the divine nature, I have likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this already and therefore ſhall ſpeak no more to theſe negatives.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106859:41"/>may take it in, I ſhall uſe as few termes of art as may bee, the truth in this point is above art. note.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a generall union, &amp; an <hi>eſpeciall</hi> union, between God and his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This union whither generall or ſpeciall is <hi>reall,</hi> really uniting them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This reall union is the originall of a reall <hi>Communion</hi> between God and the creature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This reall union may be <hi>diverſely</hi> Conſidered, according to the diverſe reſpects, and diverſe effects of union.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every union between God and the creature, is not this myſticall union of which we ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Gratious ſoule myſtically united unto God. may bee thus united unto God in <hi>more</hi> reſpects then one.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For diſtinctions ſake (whither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly or improperly) wee may ſay there are ſeverall unions: though indeed, properly, ſeverall modes or waies of union, between God and the elect ſoul. this premiſed I conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The elect ſoul hath God united to it, (though not onely,) in the generall and univerſall union. in reſpect of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106859:41"/>which <hi>God</hi> may be ſaid to be united to the whole creation. this is not as an Elect ſoule, but in Common as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this union I take to be held out in that text. In him we live and moove and have our being. this union for its forme, is made up 1. on gods part, by that common ſpirit, (or ſpirit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in fluences) which actuates the whole creation, <hi>in' eſſe &amp; operari,</hi> in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and operation, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. 2. on the creatures part, by that dependance (natural) which the creature hath on <hi>God,</hi> for this <hi>eſſe &amp; operari,</hi> through the ſpirit. he that knowes not this, knowes little, this union every creature hath with <hi>Gods:</hi> Familiſts goe no higher then this, they may be thus united unto God, and yet divels. but this union the elect ſoul hath, as a creature, and more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The elect ſoule hath God united to it, in a <hi>ſpeciall:</hi> (which is called a my. ſticall union.) in reſpect of which <hi>God</hi> is not united to the whole creation,

            <p n="3">3. This union, wherein the elect ſoule
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106859:42"/>hath <hi>God</hi> united to it, is not an Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate but a mediate union, through a <hi>mediatour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.

Chriſt is this mediatour and the union is through him. John 17. read the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This union through a mediatour may be conſidered, either firſt as uniting <hi>God</hi> and the ſoule, (the mediatour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening.) or ſecondly, as uniting the mediatour and the elect ſoule.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This union may be conſidered, with reſpect 1. to the preſent ſtate of grace: or ſecondly the future State of glory.</p>

            <p>God, through the mediatour, as a <hi>principle, a working-cauſe</hi> of a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> being and operation, unites himſelf to the elect ſoule enlightning it, quickning it, &amp;c. with ſpeciall grace.</p>
            <p>This is on gods part, 1.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.</note> by that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſpirit (or the ſpeciall Influences of the ſpirit) which actuates the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall elect ſoule, in its ſpirituall being &amp; operation. 2.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.13.</note> on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures part, by the dependance of the ſpirituall ſoule on god for this, wrought in it by the ſpirit.</p>

            <p>I ſhall ſpeak a word concerning the Effects of theſe Unions, theſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this In-being of God and Chriſt in us.

            <p>Q. The agent working in us is Chriſt, the Father, the Spirit, but what is the <hi>thing wrought</hi> upon us? the working virtue is the power of God; but what's the effect?</p>
            <p>An. This is not God himſelf. God of God,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.16</note> I ſay that grace wrought in us (I ſuppoſe we may agree to call it grace, let it be what it will) is not God, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eſſence of God, <hi>produced</hi> in us: there is the Being of God, the Eſſence of God God himſelf <hi>producing,</hi> but the thing <hi>produced,</hi> is not God, is not the Perſon of Chriſt, is not the Perſon of the ſpirit, though theſe Perſons be there, in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way of Preſence and Union to effect it.

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.21 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18</note> 1. I ſay grace is a fruit of the ſpirit. 2. It is a diſpoſition in us, a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our underſtandings and wils, and affections, and Gods working in us is not to ſet up a third thing between God and us,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pat.</hi> 1.21.</note> but to diſpoſe, and frame, and order our ſpirits to move towards him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This work is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed through <hi>inſtruments,

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 13.25.</note> to effect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on the hearts and minds of men in an ordinary way as Inſtruments: true, man cannot do it alone without God, and God will not do it alone without man, I mean ordinarily.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The alteration it makes upon the man, on whom 'tis wrought, 'tis no <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall alteration,</hi> ſubſtantiall alteration, the man is man ſtill, and but man, though better qualified, a ſpirituallized man, his underſtanding is cleared of darkneſſe, and ſtrengthened by the enlightning of the ſpirit of God, to underſtand more clearly the things of God. There is not a new faculty of ſeeing, but the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance removed, (the vaile as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the underſtanding) and help affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, light brought into a dark room,

            <p>So the will, the will is will ſtill, no new ſoule, but the action of the ſoule purified. There's a new diſpoſition, its called new, becauſe it was old and is made new as 'twere there is a new ſtamp upon it, a peece of filver was ſilver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goldſmith toucht it. An old

            <p>If it be God, then the ſoule is turned into God, a creature made a God: for 'tis the ſoule that hath this work.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpeak much as to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Eſai 40. ult. <hi>Who gave Jacob to the ſpoile, and Iſrael to the robbers, did not I the Lord?</hi> was his Text.</p>
            <p>His point of doctrine (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) was this: that God gives up his owne people to robbers and ſpoilers.</p>
            <p>In the explication, he told us, that theſe robbers were ſuch as ſhould ſpoile gods own people of their Prieſts and Altars, &amp;c. and at length of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106859:49"/>by ſin, blaſphemies, wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Coppe</hi> on the Lords day before this lecture, preached neere <hi>Witney:</hi> his Text (as I am informed) was. There is a time to ſing, and a time to dance. it ſeems he was very merry. (ſome men ſuch as rejoyce in wickedneſſe, are very merry when, (they cannot be unleſſe) they have, the Divell for their play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow. as I have read of Witches, ſo I have heard of ſome Familiſts and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that (literally) they dance dirges with the Divell.) in that diſcourſe (as I heard from ſome that knew it.) he ſaid that the whole Scripture from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of geneſis to the end of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations was to be underſtood allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically. This I am ſure, is the ſence of all Familiſts. No wonder then that ſuch doctrines are drawne from ſuch Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Familiſts <hi>(ex profeſſo)</hi> bring Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to their private ſpirit, and make Scripture ſpeak according to that. They will not try their ſpirit by the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of god in the Scripture, nor ſpeake according to the Law, and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Scripture. When men leave Scripture: or preſume to interpret
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106859:49"/>Scripture in their owne (if not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels) ſence: what doctrines muſt we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? no wonder, that gods giving his people over to afflictions, and (as I take it from the ſcope of the Scripture) Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to captivity and (literally) robbers and ſpoilers bee interpreted. a giving up of his owne people to ſin, curſe, ſweare, blaſpheme. God as a father may well chaſtiſe correct &amp; his children, actually, effectually; I trow, not ſo give up his people to the power of ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take this note:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 1.13.</note> god tempts no man to ſin, he that ſinneth is lead away into ſin by his own Luſt; and the inſtigation of the divell-underſtand this effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the working cauſe. ſin is of the divel, he is the Father, and our corrupt hearts they are the mothers of theſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh brats.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is not a principle of ſin in god,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> he is good, and purely good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good. he were not god had he ſuch weakneſſe, and contradiction. The god of Familiſts whom they generally ſo ſerve is the —, he is the ſink of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Farther, god permiſſively, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſin to be, for ends beſt known unto himſelfe.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106859:50"/>
            <p n="4">4. On the ſame account, God may ſuffer the Divel to lay his ſnares, and leave his people to themſelves- and they may be inſnared in theſe, and ſin, but yet hee's not the cauſe of ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He forbids ſin, gave ſtrength once againſt ſin, and now more then they will uſe: if men neglect this ſtrength, nay ſin away this ſtrength, is God bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their ſtrength, that they may not ſin? and ſhall God on this be the cauſe of ſin? god forbid.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God may judicially give over ſome men to ſin — give Sathan the charge of them,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> the power of them. to doe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them what he will and can, god withdrawes from them (judicially) his good gifts, and whats his owne, and whom have theſe to blame? if they with a full careere run on in ſinne, they run freely downe the ſtreame of ſin, 'tis their choice to ſin, why ſhall god be blam'd for this?</p>
            <p>If God and Chriſt doe ſay, thou ſhalt not take the name of god in vaine,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euod.</hi> 20.</note> and <hi>Coppe</hi> and others ſweare themſelves into the bottomleſſe pit of hell, why may not god leave them there?
<note place="margin">

               <hi>Coppe</hi> applied his doctrine, firſt to their comfort, who with himſelfe were ſpoiled, they ſhould not be troubled: for god gave them up. Helliſh comfort for ſuch wretches. I grant, god judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gave the Divell leave to doe what he would with them. I ſay this is hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh comfort, to be in the divels hands by Gods judiciall appointment. he would have others not only pitty them, but love them as Brethren. but what compaſſion ſhould others ſhew them? the weake god pitties, ſpares, pardons, ſo ſhould we.</p>
            <p>The obſtinate, the rebellious, he lets run the long run to hel and judgement, let them take what they meet with in the way of ſin, Juſtice from god, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, by the Magiſtrate; extraordinary, by his owne hand, and damnation in the end of ſin.</p>
